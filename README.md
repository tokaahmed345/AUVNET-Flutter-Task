  
# 🛍️ AUVNET Flutter  Task

This is a simple, responsive e-commerce Flutter application built as part of the AUVNET internship task. It follows Clean Architecture principles and uses the BLoC pattern for state management. Firebase is used for backend services, and Hive is used for local caching.

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

This project follows **Clean Architecture** with a clear separation of concerns:

```
lib/
├── core/                 # Shared base classes, constants, utilities
├── features/
│   └── auth/             # Authentication feature (login, signup)
│   └── home/             # Home screen features (services, products, etc.)
│   └── onboarding/       # Onboarding flow
├── data/                 # Repositories, Models, Data Sources (local & remote)
├── domain/               # Entities, Repositories contracts, Use cases
├── presentation/         # UI, BLoC, Events, States, Widgets
├── main.dart             # App entry point
```

## ⚙️ State Management

Used [`flutter_bloc`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc) for all BLoC-related state control.

- All states are immutable and use `copyWith()` for state updates.
- Each feature (auth, onboarding, home) has its own bloc, state, and event files.
- Global `BlocObserver` is implemented for debugging purposes.

---

## 🔐 Firebase Integration

- **Authentication**: Firebase Email/Password.
- **Cloud Firestore**: Stores product/service data.
- **Firebase Storage**: Handles product image uploading.

Firebase is initialized securely with environment-based configuration using `flutter_dotenv`.

---

## 📦 Local Storage (Hive)

Hive is used to store:
- User preferences
- Onboarding viewed state
- Offline cache for services or shortcuts (if needed)

---
## 🗄️ Supabase Storage Integration

To manage media storage in the app—especially for images displayed in the Home Screen—**Supabase Storage** was integrated as an alternative to Firebase Storage.

- Used the `supabase_flutter` package for authentication and storage operations.
- Product and banner images in the Home Screen are fetched directly from Supabase buckets.
- The integration is designed to be modular and scalable, allowing for easy expansion to other features in the future.
- Supabase Storage provides a simple API with signed URL support, which ensures secure and efficient media delivery.
- Files are organized under specific folders in the bucket to maintain a clean structure (e.g., `products/`, `banners/`).

This approach provides full flexibility and control over storage, especially useful for apps requiring custom storage logic or moving away from Firebase.

## 🎨 UI/UX

- Fully responsive for mobile screens.
- UI built using `flutter_screenutil` and `LayoutBuilder`.
- The design closely mirrors the official [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1516187112598079359/flutter-internship-task).
- Adaptive light/dark theme support is considered (optional enhancement).
